# Hextech CSS
**You can preview the framework here:** http://gh.imlucas.com.br/hextech

Hextech is the name of the visual identity of the game League of Legends since 2016. As their client is made using web technologies, I though (and two other people with abandoned projects on GitHub) it would be a great idea to recreate it in CSS and share as just another CSS framework.

:warning: Note that Hextech CSS is **under development** and it's far to be complete. Anyway, feel free if you want to use it in your projects or help it grow up.

## Getting started
If you want to get started right away, the easiest method you can use is this HTML template. Just copy/paste this code in a file and save it on your computer.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="hextech.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <a href="#" class="btn btn-primary">Button</a><br><br>
